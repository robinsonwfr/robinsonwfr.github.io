<p style="color:aliceblue"> I wasn't like every other kid, you know, who dreams about being an astronaut, I was always more 
    interested in what bark was made out of on a tree. Richard Gere's a real hero of mine. 
    Sting. Sting would be another person who's a hero. The music he's created over the years, 
    I don't really listen to it, but the fact that he's making it, I respect that. 
    I care desperately about what I do. Do I know what I'm doing today? No. 
    But I'm here, and I'm gonna give it my best shot.
